# University_Tests_System
Most of the classes in this project models a certain type of entity related to the university tests system like students, tests etc.

# GUI
* First of you need to copy the path of the txt file (12StudentsData) to the this class in line 106, afterwards you'd be able to run the project.
* At the beginning, the GUI asks to choose the probabilty of error for each teaching assistant and the number of Exams Department Workers.
* Once you click on "Start" it would take few seconds until the first students will finish their tests.
